Application Name: Hacker Insider

Project Topic/Objective: For my semester project I will be working on a news application that allows users to make an account and post trending news on 
cybersecurity. This might include zero-day vulnerabilities, recent breaches, and best security practices to follow. It will display the most recent posts, 
comments that other users added, and likes. It will also include other categories like top news and the application will allow for users to interact via the 
comments and also for them to view each others profile that can include things like name, company they work for, role in their company, profile picture and 
linkedinn profile to later connect.

Motivation: Since interning as a cybersecurity intern in high school, I knew that was the path I wanted to take. As an aspiring cybersecurity analyst, it is 
crucial to stay on top of current cybersecurity breaches and vulnerabilities. I want to create an application that is cybersecurity related, so that I can 
familiarze myself on reading the current trends and being familiar with current breaches. This app will allow for cybersecurity professionals to connect and 
help each other better protect their organization. I hope to learn more about this field while applying my programming skills which is also essential to know 
in cybersecurity.

Server-Side Components: A users profile will be stored which includes name, profile picture, role, LinkedIn information, and interests. The posts, comments, 
the date that post is created, likes will also be stored, etc.
